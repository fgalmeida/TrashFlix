### How to work this website:
1. Place your API's Keys in `src\pages\api\requests.ts` and `src\pages\api\auth\[...nextauth].js`.
2. Enter in the console: npm i or npm install
3. And start with `npm run start` or `npm run dev`

You can now access [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) of your browser.
